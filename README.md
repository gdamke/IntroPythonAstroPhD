# Welcome to the **Introductory Course of Python for Astronomy Graduate Students** 

Notes created by Dr. Guillermo Damke, for the graduate (PhD) Astronomy program at Universidad de La Serena, Chile.


## Objective


This material seeks to provide the relevant tools in Python for graduate students in Astronomy, **focusing on learning how to *think in Python***.

This course is designed to be taught in 1.5-hour classes, once a week, for a semester.
